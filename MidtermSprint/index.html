            <h2>Our Owner</h2>
            <br />
            <p>Meet Jim Smith, the one and only Master Blacksmith.</p>
            <br />
            <p>
              With over two decades of experience at the forge, Jim has honed
              the art of blacksmithing into both a passion and a profession.
              <br />
              Beginning as an apprentice in a small local workshop, Jim quickly
              developed a deep appreciation for the ancient techniques of
              metalworking. <br />
              Over the years, he has mastered the craft, blending traditional
              methods with innovative designs to create stunning, handcrafted
              metal pieces.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              From delicate trinkets to custom metalwork, Jim has built a
              reputation for meticulous attention to detail and a unique
              artistic flair. <br />
              He believes that every piece, no matter how small, tells a
              story—and it's that philosophy that drives every creation.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              When Jim isn't in the shop, you'll find him sourcing the finest
              materials or working with clients on custom projects. <br />
              He ensures that every piece reflects the timeless beauty and
              craftsmanship that defines his work.
